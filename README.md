# Valmiki's Crypto Dashboard
### A Bolt.DIY Generated Crypto Dashboard

This code was completely generated using Bolt.Diy locally with Claude Sonnet 3.5 via OpenRouter.ai. The total cost of the app would be around $2-$3 whilst using Sonnet 3.5. While this is a pretty simple and straightforward app, I'd clearly consider recommending this route for all those who aren't so code savvy, as its way way cheaper than hiring a full or mid-stack developer.
